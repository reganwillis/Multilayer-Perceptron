# Multilayer Perceptron #

This code is sampled from a working multilayer perceptron that has been used in research. No information regarding the type of data used, data manipulation strategies, or features extracted are included in this repository. This repository serves as an example of my coding style, competancy working with complex systems, and use of scikit-learn for neural networks.

I assisted with collecting the data used in this NN. I determined which type of NN to use, which type of activation algorithm to use, and tuned the hyperparameters based on the nature of the data. In conjunction with company scripts, I was able show results up to 85-92% accuracy with just 800 inputs from our dataset.
